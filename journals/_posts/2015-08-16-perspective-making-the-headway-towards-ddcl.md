Let me just say, the main purpose of creating DDCL Website was to show-case their projects, sorted them neatly and most importantly a luminous design. In the view of starting the initial work, I badly needed some contents. As a decent designer, I didn’t want to do any guesswork without any content. That’s why asked for 3 or 4 projects’ contents. After one week of the meeting, I got 3 contents in my hand. Those were,

1) 5 Star Sonargaon Hotel and lately The Extension of the Existing Five Star PAN PACIFIC SONARGAON HOTEL in Dhaka,

2) Dhaka Mass Rapid Transit Development Project and lastly

3) Kuril Flyover.

Now I can go-off to the work.


Happy Design
