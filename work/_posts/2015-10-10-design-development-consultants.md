They have unique knowledge and the connections that have been established over many years of doing business in this country.

handicraft: "It’s totally new for me to work with such ancient and giant company. After three meetings with them, I came to know that they got few demands in a very large scale. The main target to build this site was to organize their 43 years’ projects sequentially and to provide the intuition to build up own career with ddcl- whoever visits this site.

Until now, they are offering 23 services including more than 100 projects. I branded their 6 services and used simple six color with brand identity encompassed by minimal color according to the project value to easily identify the projects in this site Despite the vastness of the contents, I tried to keep the site more quick and cozy."
